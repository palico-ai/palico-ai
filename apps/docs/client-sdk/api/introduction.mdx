## Introduction

To interact with your Palico app, you will need the API URL and a service key. The service key is a JWT token that is used to authenticate your requests to the Palico API.

You will need to pass the service key in the `Authorization` header of your requests. Here's an example of how you can call an agent using the Palico REST API with your application running on `http://localhost:8000`:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/health \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_KEY"
```
