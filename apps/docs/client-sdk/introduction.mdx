The `@palico-ai/client-js` is a Javascript library that helps you communicate with your Palico application. This library should primarily be used in secured server-side environments, such as a NodeJS server or a NextJS server runtime.

## Setup and Installation

To install the Palico Client SDK on your NodeJS project, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @palico-ai/client-js
```

### Create a Palico Client

<Steps>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Palico Client">
    ```typescript
    import { createClient } from "@palico-ai/client-js";

    const client = createClient({
      serviceKey: "<your-service-key>",
      apiURL: "http://localhost:8000", // replace with your API URL
    });
    ```

  </Step>

## Calling an Agent
Here's an example of how you can call an agent using the Palico Client SDK:
```typescript
const response = await client.agent.chat({
  agentName: "chat",
  userMessage: "What is the weather today?",
  payload: {
    location: "San Francisco",
  },
  appConfig: {
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    provider: "openai",
  },
});

const { conversationId, requestId, message, data, toolCalls } = response;
```

Learn about the API reference for the `chat` method [here](#api-reference).

## Stream Response
You can also stream the response from the agent. Here's an example of how you can stream the response from the agent:
```typescript
  const response = await client.agent.chat({
    agentName: "chat_stream",
    userMessage: "Hello",
    appConfig: {},
    stream: true,
  });

for await (const chunk of response.readChunks()) {
  // Do something with the chunk
}
```

You can also get the merged chunks from the stream _during_ or _after_ the stream has completed:
```typescript
const mergedChunks = await response.getMergedChunks();
```

    Should the response be streamed back to the client
  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="toolCallResults" type="ToolCallResult[]">
    For client-side tool execution, the results of the tool call. The schema for a ToolCallResult is as follows:
    ```typescript
    interface ToolCallResult {
      name: string;
      result: any;
    }
    ```
  </ResponseField>

  </ResponseField>
  <ResponseField name="toolCalls" type="ToolCall[]">
    If the agent requires a client-side tool execution, this field will contain the tool name and parameters. The schema for a ToolCall is as follows:
    ```typescript
    interface ToolCall {
      id: string;
      name: string;
