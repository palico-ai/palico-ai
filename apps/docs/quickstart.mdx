## Requirements

- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Setup and Installation

<Steps>

<Step title="Initialize a Palico Application">

```bash
npx palico init <project-name>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Add your Open API Key">

This starter LLM application uses OpenAI so you will need to add an OpenAI API key in your `.env` file. You can get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.

```bash .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
```

</Step>

<Step title="Start your Palico App">

```bash
npm start
```

</Step>

</Steps>

The starter app comes with a few example agents. You can modify them in the `src/agents/<agent-name>/index.ts` file.
